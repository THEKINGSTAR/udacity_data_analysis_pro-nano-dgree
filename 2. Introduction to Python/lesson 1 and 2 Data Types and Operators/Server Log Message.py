""" Server Log Message
Quiz: Write a Server Log Message
In this programming quiz, you’re going to use what you’ve learned about strings to write a logging message for a server.

You’ll be provided with example data for a user, the time of their visit and the site they accessed.
 You should use the variables provided and the techniques you’ve learned to 
 print a log message like this one(with the username, url, and timestamp replaced with values 
 from the appropriate variables):

Yogesh accessed the site http: // petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16: 20.

username = "Kinari"
timestamp = "04:50"
url = "http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats"

# TODO: print a log message using the variables above.
# The message should have the same format as this one:
# "Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20."\

log_message = username + " " + "accessed the site" + " " + url + " " + "at" +" "+ timestamp +"."

print(log_message)
