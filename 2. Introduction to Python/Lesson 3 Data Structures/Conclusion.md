Congratulations on completing this lesson on Data Structures!
A good understanding of data structures is integral for programming and data analysis. As a data analyst, you will be working with data and code all the time, 
so a solid understanding of what data types and data structures are available and when to use each one will help you write more efficient code.

Remember, you can get more practice on sites like HackerRank.

In this lesson, we covered four important data structures in Python:

Data Structure	Ordered	Mutable	Constructor	Example
List	Yes	Yes	[ ] or list()	[5.7, 4, 'yes', 5.7]
Tuple	Yes	No	( ) or tuple()	(5.7, 4, 'yes', 5.7)
Set	No	Yes	{}* or set()	{5.7, 4, 'yes'}
Dictionary	No	No**	{ } or dict()	{'Jun': 75, 'Jul': 89}
* You can use curly braces to define a set like this: {1, 2, 3}. However, if you leave the curly braces empty like this: {} Python will instead create an empty dictionary.
 So to create an empty set, use set().
** A dictionary itself is mutable, but each of its individual keys must be immutable.
