""" When to use Dictionaries?
Let's revisit our Wall Street example from before. 
Previously we created a list for the index fund, 
Vanguard Institutional Index Fund,
 because we wanted to print the names of the holdings ( or stocks) in the index fund.

Now, let's say as the investment fund manager for VINIX, 
you also want to print a few more details for each holding. For e.g., what is your rate of return on each of the holdings?

A dictionary will work well here as there is a key: value association.
In other words, there is a linkage between each holding and the information(e.g., rate of return), 
and it can be organized under one index fund, VINIX. """
