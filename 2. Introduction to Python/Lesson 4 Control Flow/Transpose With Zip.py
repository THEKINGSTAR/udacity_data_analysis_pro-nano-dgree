Quiz: Transpose with Zip
Use zip to transpose data from a 4-by-3 matrix to a 3-by-4 matrix. 
There's actually a cool trick for this! Feel free to look at the solutions if you can't figure it out.

data = ((0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (9, 10, 11))

data_transpose = # replace with your code
print(data_transpose)

 """
data = ((0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (9, 10, 11))

data_transpose = list( zip(zip(*data))) # replace with your code
print(data_transpose)
