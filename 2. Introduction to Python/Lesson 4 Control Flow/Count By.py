Quiz: Count By
Suppose you want to count from some number start_num by another number count_by until you hit a final number end_num. Use break_num as the variable that
 you'll change each time through the loop. For simplicity, assume that end_num is always larger than start_num and count_by is always positive.

Before the loop, what do you want to set break_num equal to? How do you want to change break_num each time through
 the loop? What condition will you use to see when it's time to stop looping?

After the loop is done, print out break_num, showing the value that indicated it was time to stop looping. 
It is the case that break_num should be a number that is the first number larger than end_num.

start_num = 3 #provide some start number
end_num = 30#provide some end number that you stop when you hit
count_by = 2#provide some number to count by 

# write a while loop that uses break_num as the ongoing number to 
#   check against end_num
while

print(break_num)
